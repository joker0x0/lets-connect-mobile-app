#The application

The government can: 1. Post announcements (such as water pipes will undergo maintenance from date x to date y, Road x will be closed on this day… and so on). They can also upload pictures or files (pdf for example) in case the announcement needs that. You are free to add any details or categorizations to this part.  2. Create polls (such as suggesting a new bridge, or suggesting renovating a public place) and the citizens can vote with or against. Check results. 3. Check private messages sent by the citizens and reply to them. 4. Add official phone numbers and approved ads posted by advertisers. The citizens can: 1. Check announcements and comment on them. 2. Participate in the voting (polling) process and optionally adding comments. Voting should be anonymous and allowed once, while commenting can be public or anonymous as well. 3. Send messages to the government. 4. Report problems (such as lights not working in street x, water broke in street y) and upload pictures, as well as mark the location of the problem on the map. 5. Check emergency numbers and official numbers (like calling ambulance, police, hospitals…) The advertisers can: 1. Post advertisements (images) and other types of data about new places or products in the neighborhood (such as new dry clean, new bakery, or reduced items in some existing store… and so on).
